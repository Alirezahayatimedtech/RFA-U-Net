# RFA-U-Net: RETFound Attention U-Net for OCT Choroid Segmentation

RFA-U-Net is a deep learning model designed for segmenting the choroid in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images. It combines a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder pre-trained with RETFound weights and an Attention U-Net decoder. The model is optimized using Tversky and Dice loss functions and evaluated with metrics such as Dice scores and boundary errors (in micrometers).

## Features

- **Encoder**: Pre-trained RETFound Vision Transformer for robust feature extraction  
- **Decoder**: Attention U-Net with skip connections for precise choroid segmentation  
- **Loss Functions**: Tversky and Dice loss to handle class imbalance  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Dice score, signed/unsigned boundary errors (in micrometers)  
- **Visualization**: Boundary visualization with true and predicted masks

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- PyTorch 1.9.0 or higher  
- NVIDIA GPU (recommended for training)  
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`  

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alirezahayatimedtech/RFA-U-Net.git
cd RFA-U-Net
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the pre-trained RETFound weights (`RETFound_oct_weights.pth`) from this Google Drive link and place them in the `weights/` directory. See `weights/README.md` for details.

Clone the RETFound_MAE repository for model definitions:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rmaphoh/RETFound_MAE.git
```

## Dataset

The model expects OCT images and corresponding choroid masks in the following structure:

```
data/
├── images/
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   ├── image2.tif
│   └── ...
└── masks/
    ├── image1_mask.png
    ├── image2_mask.png
    └── ...
```

- **Images**: RGB OCT images (3 channels)  
- **Masks**: Binary masks (single channel) for the choroid region  

**Note**: Due to privacy concerns, the dataset is not included. Users must provide their own OCT dataset with the above structure.

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. Prepare the dataset: Ensure your dataset follows the structure above and is placed in a `data/` directory.

2. Update the configuration in `src/retfound.py`:
```python
image_dir = 'path/to/your/data/images'
mask_dir = 'path/to/your/data/masks'
config = {
    "image_size": 224,
    "hidden_dim": 1024,
    "patch_size": 16,
    "num_channels": 3,
    "num_classes": 2,
    "retfound_weights_path": "weights/RETFound_oct_weights.pth"
}
```

3. Train the model:
```bash
python src/retfound.py
```

This will train the model for 50 epochs, evaluate on the validation set, and visualize the first batch of the test set using `plot_boundaries`.

### Visualizing Results

To visualize segmentation results on a specific image:

- Open `examples/visualization.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
- Update the notebook to load your image and mask.
- Run the notebook to generate visualizations, including:
  - Original image  
  - True mask  
  - Predicted mask  
  - Boundaries overlay (true upper: red, true lower: green, predicted upper: blue, predicted lower: yellow)  

## Results


- **Test Dice Score**: ~0.95  
- **Boundary Errors**:  
  - Upper Signed Error: ~-0.89 μm 
  - Upper Unsigned Error: ~6.04 μm 
  - Lower Signed Error: ~1.05 μm  
  - Lower Unsigned Error: ~21.4 μm
