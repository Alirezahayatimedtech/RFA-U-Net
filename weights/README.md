Here's a **cleaned-up, user-friendly, and Markdown-polished** version of your section, ready to be placed in your `weights/README.md` or main `README.md` file:

## 📦 Pre-trained Weights

The pre-trained weights for **RFA-U-Net** (`rfa_unet_best.pth`) are automatically downloaded the first time you run the main script (`src/retfound.py`). These weights are the best checkpoint obtained after training on an OCT dataset and can be used directly for inference or further fine-tuning.

---

## 📁 Details

* **File**: `rfa_unet_best.pth`
* **Source**: Automatically downloaded from Google Drive
* **Usage**: The script checks for the file and downloads it if missing. The weights support both inference and continued training (see instructions in [README.md](../README.md)).

---

## 📝 Notes

* To **force re-download** of the weights, simply delete the existing `rfa_unet_best.pth` file in the `weights/` directory and re-run the script.
* Make sure the `gdown` library is installed (it is included in `requirements.txt`) — it handles the download automatically.

```bash
pip install gdown  # Only if needed manually
```

Let me know if you'd like to link this to an actual hosted file or include a direct `gdown` command with a shareable Google Drive ID.
